# speedtiergenerator
This program takes in a list of Pokemon, calculates their speed, then creates a formatted speed tier list that can be posted to Smogon. This project was originally created for ADV LC and needs to be refactored before it can be used for other purposes.

# Usage
Replace the contents of "input.txt" with a list of Pokemon you would like to create a speed tier list for, seperated by commas.
